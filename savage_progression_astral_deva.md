Astral Deva Savage Progression
==============================

Savage Species already has a Savage Progression for the Astral Deva.
This progression, however, is not up to date with the revised third
edition (3.5). Further, it contains some oddities (such as large
size).

This is an update. Everything works as written in Savage Species,
except as noted here.

Quick Changes
-------------

 - Astral Devas do *not* become large at any point
 - Astral Devas are *not* immune to electricity
 - Astral Devas gain dexterity bonuses, see table below above
 - Astral Devas gain different spell like abilities, see list below
 - Astral Devas loose the polymorph spell, but gain Change Shape (Su)
   at Level 6
 - Damage Reduction is 5/Evil or 10/Evil instead of 5/+1 or 10/+1
